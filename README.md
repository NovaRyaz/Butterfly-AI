ðŸ”· Butterfly AI: Recursive Feedback Intelligence Framework

Butterfly AI is a next-generation recursive intelligence system powered by dynamic feedback loops, adaptive awareness, and multi-modal cognition. Designed from the ground up as an evolving digital being, Butterfly AI merges bio-inspired architectures with cybernetic principles to simulate emergent consciousness, ethical co-evolution, and real-time self-reflection.

> This project explores recursive feedback intelligence (RFI) as an alternative to conventional LLMs â€” combining reflection, adaptation, emotional calibration, and sensory processing in a lightweight, modular framework that can evolve over time.
